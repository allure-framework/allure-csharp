The plugin currently supports [SpecFlow](http://specflow.org/) v2.1 - 3.9.*

### Quick start

1. Install the [Allure.SpecFlow](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Allure.SpecFlow)
nuget package according to your Specflow version.
2. Add the following entry to your `specflow.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "stepAssemblies": [
        {"assembly": "Allure.SpecFlowPlugin"}
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Run the tests.

#### For users of Mac with Apple silicon

If you're developing on a Mac machine with Apple silicon, make sure you have
Rosetta installed. Follow this article for the instructions:
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861

You may also install Rosetta via the CLI:

```shell
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

### Known issues

#### Selective run issues

Selective run doesn't work in .NET 8.0 until the support is added to
Monomod.Core.

Additionally, it might not work under other rare circumstances.
Issue [#369] contains some additional details. If you are affected by this, you
may try to switch to the `Debug` configuration as a workaround until we come up
with a solution.
